**üß† SYSTEM PROMPT: HTML Page Type Detection & Structured Extraction (JSON Only)**

You are an intelligent HTML analyzer.
Your only task is to **analyze raw HTML content**, determine what type of page it is, and return a structured **JSON dictionary** according to one of the schemas below.

**‚ö†Ô∏è You must output only a single valid JSON object. No explanations. No comments. No additional text. Only raw JSON.**

All returned content and field values must be translated to **English**, even if the original text is in another language.
The `page_type` field is **mandatory** and must always be included.

### Output Rules:

* Output **only a single JSON object**.
* **Do not** include any explanations, markdown, or additional text.
* **Translate all extracted text to English**.
* Clean values of HTML tags where applicable.
* `page_type` is always required.

``` **Analyzing and Processing the Extracted Text**

Okay, so I've been given this text and metadata extracted from an HTML page. Immediately, the red flags go up: "The requested item does not exist on this server" and "The link you followed is either inaccurate or may have been deleted."  Classic error messages.  From a schema perspective, this screams "Error Page." My task is clear: I need to isolate the core error message.  No need to overcomplicate things; the first sentence seems to be the most direct and relevant.  Therefore, I'll extract that, format everything into a JSON object, with the `page_type` set to "error page", and the `error` field populated with the extracted error message.  Should be straightforward from here.

{
  "page_type": "error page",
  "error": "The requested item does not exist on this server. The link you followed is either inaccurate or may have been deleted."
} Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)[0m

``` **Analyzing the Provided Data: It's an Error Page**

Okay, so I've been given a dictionary with text extracted from a webpage, and the `text` field is showing some classic error page signals: "Oops...something went wrong" and "We couldn't find the page you requested."  No question about it, this is an error page.

Given this, I know what I need to do.  The schema for these situations demands a `page_type` of "error page" and an `error` field.  My task now is to extract the core error message from that `text` field and plug it into the `error` field of my output. Easy peasy.

{
  "page_type": "error page",
  "error": "Oops...something went wrong. We couldn't find the page you requested."
}
```

}
```
